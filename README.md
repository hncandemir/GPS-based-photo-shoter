# GPS-based-photo-shoter
Coordinate based automatic photo shoter to create an evidence archieve.
We have created a new system for public transport operators with their own specific rules.
These private operators work for their own profit.
There are many busses with its private owners on one bus line and they share the same transportation rights.
Each bus has its specified departure time and this defines the distance between two busses wich have to keep.
The distance between two busses varries form 4 mintutes to 15 minutes by time of day.
The problem is there is many traffic on the road which makes it difficult to keep the distance between two busses.
We have developed a subsidy system to associate money and time rights.
Drivers who spend too much time are punished.
Drivers who use less time will receive money compensation.
Some drivers are trying to get money back by cheating
Tactics: Going off the route, passing the stop, over-speeding
Only GPS data do not fulfill the requirements
So we need additional evidence for road lane tracking
